# Recommendation Systems without Explicit ID Features: A Literature Review

<!-- <font size=6><center><big><b> [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re) </b></big></center></font> -->

Paper list of LLM (Large Language Model), multimodal, transferable and foundation Recommender System. 

**Keyword:** *Recommend System, pretraining, large language model, multimodal recommender system, transferable recommender system, foundation recommender models, ID features, ID embeddings*

**These papers attempt to address the following questions:** 

(1) Can recommender systems have their own foundation models similar to those used in NLP and CV? 

(2) Can explicit item ID embeddings be replaced or abandoned? 

(3) Will recommender systems shift from a matching paradigm to a generating paradigm?

(4) How can LLM be utilized to enhance recommender systems?

(5) What does the future hold for multimodal recommender systems?
